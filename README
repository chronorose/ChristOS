- [x] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be
thy name.
- [x] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.
- [x] Give us this day our
daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us
- [x] and lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
